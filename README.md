# Phase 1 Week 1 Code Challenge
## Project Description
This README.md describes the code submitted alongside this document. The code challenge consists of three code challenges described below.
#### Challenge 1:Student Grade Generator
> Write a program that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade as follows: 
A > 79, B > 60 to 79, C > 49 to 59, D > 40 to 49, E > less 40.
#### Challenge 2:Speed Detector 
> Write a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.
For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.
#### Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator
>Given the basic salary and benefits of an employee, write a program that would calculate the Payee Tax, NHIF, NSSF Deductions and net salary.

NB: Use KRA, NHIF, and NSSF values provided in the link below.
